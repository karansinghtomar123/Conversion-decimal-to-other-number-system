#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> As per Handout
###### Assessment Method: As per handout

<u> <b>Description: </b> Instructional Strategy will be implement as simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 In the simulator,the candidate will enter the decimal number and get the output as binary,octal and hexadecimal number.The simulator has default value of decimal number and also a student can enter his own number.
